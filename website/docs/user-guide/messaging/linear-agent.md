# Linear Agent Setup

Hermes can appear in Linear as a first-class **Agent**: teammates @-mention it or delegate issues to it, Linear opens an Agent Session, and Hermes replies with Agent Activities. All writes (issues, comments, projects, …) attribute to the agent's app identity — never to a human's personal token — through the bundled `linear_agent` platform plugin.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Linear OAuth app actor — writes show the agent's name and badge |
| **Transport** | Signed webhooks in (Agent Session + Issue events), GraphQL out |
| **Replies** | Agent Activities: `thought` → `elicitation` → `response`/`error` |
| **Writes** | 58 `linear_agent_*` tools, every one fail-closed behind `mutation_policy` |
| **Built to** | Linear's [Agent Interaction Guidelines](https://linear.app/developers/aig) and [best practices](https://linear.app/developers/agent-best-practices) |

## How the Agent Behaves

- A `created` Agent Session webhook (mention or delegation) becomes a new Hermes gateway session with structured Linear context; `prompted` follow-ups continue the same session.
- Linear's interaction guidelines are followed end-to-end: an ephemeral `thought` acknowledges the session immediately (`ack_on_created`), a rate-limited "Working on it…" thought shows progress during long turns, clarifying questions post as `elicitation` (the session shows *awaiting input*), final answers post as `response`, and failures as `error`.
- A human **stop** signal halts the session immediately: the in-flight turn is interrupted, nothing further is written, and one confirming activity is posted.
- The agent can attach external links (PRs, docs) to its session (`linear_agent_set_session_links`) and publish a live execution plan (`linear_agent_update_plan`, Linear Agent Plans technology preview).
- **Delegation:** by default (`auto_start_on_delegation: true`) an issue whose delegate is this agent is moved to the team's first `started` workflow state — requires `mutation_policy.update_issues`, skips triage-state issues (humans own triage), and only ever fires on a *verified* delegate match, never on generic issue edits. With `auto_self_delegate: true` (opt-in, default off) the agent also claims unclaimed issues when a session is created on them; otherwise it never sets itself as delegate.
- Issue-delegation webhooks have no Agent Session, so replies to them post as **comments** on the issue (requires `mutation_policy.create_comments`).
- Cron jobs can deliver to Linear: set `LINEAR_AGENT_HOME_TARGET` to an issue ID/identifier and `deliver=linear_agent` results post there as comments — including when cron runs out-of-process from the gateway.

### Where replies appear

- Mention the agent in a **new comment** and the agent session anchors to that comment: the answer renders in the session panel and Linear mirrors it into that comment's thread.
- Mention it **inside an existing comment thread** and Linear re-anchors the conversation: it copies your mention to a new root comment, attaches the session there, and the reply lands under that copy — not under the thread you typed in. This is Linear's session model, not agent behavior.
- The agent replies through session responses only; it never posts comments into a session-hosted thread itself (Linear does not render agent comments inside those threads, and the mirrored response would be duplicated).
- **Opt-in `reply_in_source_thread`**: when the agent is mentioned inside an existing thread, set this to also post the findings as a reply on the *source* comment — that thread is a normal thread, so the reply renders inline where the human asked. The session response still appears in the widget, so the content lands in both places; requires `mutation_policy.create_comments`.

:::note[Why this is opt-in, and when to remove it]
`reply_in_source_thread` is a **workaround for a current Linear platform limitation**, not a permanent feature. Linear's Agent Sessions API gives an agent no way to make its session response render inline in the thread it was mentioned from: `AgentActivityCreateInput` has no comment/placement field, `CommentCreateInput` has no session association, and agent comments posted into a session-hosted thread are not rendered. Only Linear's first-party `@Linear` assistant replies inline today. So when a teammate loops the agent into a thread expecting a contribution *there*, the answer otherwise only surfaces in the session widget. This flag bridges that gap by replying on the mention's source comment (a normal thread that does render), at the cost of the content appearing twice (widget + thread).

**Default off on purpose:** without the workaround this integration matches how other third-party Linear agents (e.g. Cursor) behave, keeping the platform contract clean.

**Unwind trigger:** if Linear adds native routing of a session `response` into its `sourceComment` thread (or otherwise lets third-party agents reply inline), this flag becomes redundant. At that point, remove the `reply_in_source_thread` config/env plumbing and the prompt directive in the adapter, and delete this note. `AgentSession.sourceComment` already exists in the schema, so the routing is plausibly on their side to add — tracked with Linear via their developer community.
:::

## Step 1: Create the Linear OAuth App

1. In Linear: **Settings → API → Applications → New application**.
2. Install it with `actor=app` so actions attribute to the app, not a person.
3. Add the agent scopes: `app:mentionable` and `app:assignable`, plus normal `read,write` scopes (writes stay disabled in Hermes until you enable `mutation_policy` keys).
4. Enable **client credentials** for the app — Hermes mints and refreshes app-actor tokens automatically, no browser flow needed.

:::warning[Credentials shown only once]
The Client Secret is only displayed once when you create the app. Store it in the profile `.env` immediately — never in `config.yaml` or Git.
:::

## Step 2: Enable Webhooks

1. Enable the **Agent Session events** webhook category for the app (this delivers `created`/`prompted` sessions). Enable **Issue** events too if you want delegation handling.
2. Set a **webhook signing secret** and keep it — Hermes rejects unsigned webhooks by default.

:::tip[Fail-closed by design]
No signing secret means no webhooks: Hermes refuses unsigned deliveries rather than trusting whatever reaches the port. For throwaway local testing only, `allow_unsigned_webhooks: true` opts out.
:::
3. Point the webhook URL at Hermes (path is configurable; default shown):

```text
https://your-public-host.example/hermes/linear-agent
```

## Step 3: Expose the Webhook Port

Linear cannot deliver webhooks to `localhost`. For local development, use any tunnel tool to get a public HTTPS URL. The default port is `8651` — change it with `webhook_port` if needed.

```bash
# cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8651

# devtunnel (Microsoft)
devtunnel create hermes-linear --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create hermes-linear -p 8651 --protocol https
devtunnel host hermes-linear

# ngrok
ngrok http 8651
```

Copy the `https://` URL and set Linear's webhook URL to it plus the configured path (e.g. `https://example-tunnel.trycloudflare.com/hermes/linear-agent`). Leave the tunnel running while developing. For production, point the webhook at your server's public domain instead.

## Step 4: Find Your App User ID

:::warning[Skip this and the agent talks to itself]
Every write the agent makes fires an Issue webhook back at Hermes. Without `LINEAR_AGENT_APP_USER_ID`, those echoes spawn new sessions reviewing the agent's own changes — a feedback loop. The ID also powers delegation detection, so set it before enabling any write policies.
:::

The interactive setup wizard detects and saves this automatically, and the adapter also self-discovers it from Linear each time the gateway connects — so this step is a fallback for manual setups (and worth doing anyway, so a Linear outage at startup can't leave the filter unarmed). Query it with the app token:

```bash
curl -s https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LINEAR_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ viewer { id name } }"}'
```

Use the returned `viewer.id` as `LINEAR_AGENT_APP_USER_ID` in the next step.

## Step 5: Configure Hermes

### Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

Run the guided setup command and pick **Linear Agent**:

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

The wizard goes well beyond credential entry: it **verifies your credentials against Linear** (minting an app-actor token for client credentials), **auto-detects and saves the app user ID** — the echo-filter variable from Step 4, so you can skip that step — and offers your **workspace member list** when building the authorization allowlist. It finishes by printing the webhook URL and remaining steps.

### Option B: Manual Configuration

Put secrets in the profile `.env`. **Recommended:** OAuth client credentials:

```bash
# Required
LINEAR_AGENT_CLIENT_ID=...
LINEAR_AGENT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
LINEAR_AGENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=linear_webhook_signing_secret

# Strongly recommended (see Step 4)
LINEAR_AGENT_APP_USER_ID=...

# Authorization — Linear user IDs allowed to drive the agent (fail-closed:
# with no allowlist and no allow-all, every user is denied)
LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOWED_USERS=user-id-1,user-id-2
# LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true   # any workspace member (use with care)

# Optional
LINEAR_AGENT_WORKSPACE_ID=
LINEAR_AGENT_HOME_TARGET=            # issue for cron delivery, e.g. ENG-123
```

A static app token also works instead of client credentials:

```bash
LINEAR_AGENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=lin_oauth_or_app_token
```

Then add the platform block to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
linear_agent:
  enabled: true
  webhook_host: 0.0.0.0
  webhook_port: 8651
  webhook_path: /hermes/linear-agent
  workspace_id: ""
  app_user_id: ""
  allowed_teams: []
  allowed_users: []
  allow_all_users: false
  ack_on_created: true
  # Move an issue delegated to the agent to its first "started" workflow
  # state (Linear best practice). Default true — set false to opt out.
  # Requires mutation_policy.update_issues: true; triage is left for humans.
  auto_start_on_delegation: true
  # Opt-in: also claim auto-started issues that have no delegate.
  # Default false — humans decide what the agent owns.
  auto_self_delegate: false
  # Opt-in: dispatch full agent turns for issue-update webhooks (replies
  # post as issue comments). Default false — delegation already arrives
  # as a real agent session; update webhooks only feed auto-start.
  dispatch_issue_updates: false
  # Opt-in: also reply on the source comment when mentioned mid-thread
  # (see "Where replies appear"). Requires mutation_policy.create_comments.
  reply_in_source_thread: false
  # Every write operation fails closed; enable only what you need.
  # update_projects also covers project (status) updates, milestones,
  # and initiatives.
  mutation_policy:
    create_comments: false
    update_comments: false
    update_issues: false
    create_issues: false
    update_projects: false
    create_documents: false
    update_documents: false
    create_customer_needs: false
    update_customer_needs: false
    # create_releases/update_releases also gate release NOTES.
    create_releases: false
    update_releases: false
    create_customers: false      # customer (business entity) create
    update_customers: false      # customer update
    create_labels: false         # issue label create (team or workspace)
    # Deletes are a separate fail-closed family (default false).
    delete_comments: false
    delete_customer_needs: false
    delete_status_updates: false
    delete_attachments: false
    delete_customers: false
```

You may also place the same block under `platforms.linear_agent`. Environment variables win for secrets.

Toolsets: with no `platform_toolsets.linear_agent` entry, sessions get the auto-generated `hermes-linear_agent` composite (core tools + all `linear_agent_*` tools). If you save a custom entry, include `linear_agent` in the list or the attribution-safe tools are dropped.

## Step 6: Start the Gateway and Test

```bash
hermes gateway start          # or: hermes --profile <name> gateway restart
```

Then, in Linear:

1. **@-mention the agent** on an issue — the session should acknowledge within seconds ("I'm starting work on this.") and reply as the agent.
2. **Delegate an issue** to it — the issue should move to the team's first started state (if `update_issues` is enabled).
3. Ask it to change an issue's status — the write should attribute to the agent in Linear's history.

:::tip[If nothing happens]
Watch the gateway logs (`~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/logs/gateway.log`). The two most common causes are an unsigned/mis-signed webhook (look for "Invalid webhook signature" / "Webhook secret not configured") and an unauthorized user (`Unauthorized user … on linear_agent` — add their Linear user ID to `LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOWED_USERS`). Write tools that reply "disabled by mutation_policy" are working as intended — enable the named key.
:::

## Configuration Reference

All `LINEAR_AGENT_*` environment variables are listed in the [environment variables reference](/reference/environment-variables#linear-agent-agent-sessions). YAML config wins over defaults; env vars win for secrets and are honored as fallbacks for the allowlist and behavior flags.

## Formatting and Capabilities

- Activity bodies and issue/comment content are **Markdown**; mention users with `@displayName`.
- `linear_agent_update_issue` / `create_issue` accept friendly references — `state: "Done"`, `priority: "Low"`, `assignee` by name/email/`me`, `labels`, `project`, `team`, `cycle`, `milestone`, `delegate` — and resolve them to Linear's `*Id` fields before mutating. Ambiguous or unknown names abort with the candidates listed. Success messages echo the applied fields.
- Issue relations (`blocks`/`blockedBy`/`relatedTo`, `parentId`, `duplicateOf`) and URL attachments (`links`) are managed through `update_issue`; comments support threaded replies and editing.

## Security

- Store OAuth tokens, client secrets, and webhook secrets in `.env`, not `config.yaml`.
- Unsigned webhook requests are rejected unless `allow_unsigned_webhooks: true` (or `LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS=true`) is explicitly set. When `LINEAR_AGENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is configured, requests with missing or invalid signatures are rejected.
- Authorization is two-layer and **fail-closed at both layers**. The gateway layer grants conversation access: with no `LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOWED_USERS` / `LINEAR_AGENT_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` (or DM pairing / `GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS`), every user is denied by default. The adapter checks the sender **before any webhook side effect** by consulting that same gateway authorization chain (so pairing and gateway-level grants work here too), with YAML `allowed_users` / `allow_all_users` granting as a union — an unauthorized sender gets a 403 and never triggers the ack, auto-start, or stop handling. `allowed_teams` narrows further and never grants.
- Write mutations other than Agent Activities are disabled unless `mutation_policy` explicitly permits them. Deletes are a separate fail-closed key family, never implied by update/create permissions.
- Webhook replay is deduplicated, and issue-update echoes of the agent's own writes are filtered via `LINEAR_AGENT_APP_USER_ID`.
- The adapter does not persist raw webhook payloads outside the normal Hermes session flow.

## Limitations

- Creating the Linear OAuth app itself happens in Linear's developer UI (Hermes-side setup is interactive via `hermes gateway setup`).
- Per-tool `action` activities (streaming each tool call into the session timeline) are not yet emitted; progress shows as ephemeral thoughts.
- After a gateway restart, a `prompted` follow-up starts a fresh Hermes session with only the follow-up text — prior session context is not yet rebuilt from Linear's session/activity history.
- Binary attachment uploads (multipart) and documentation search are not covered by `linear_agent_*` tools — use the Linear MCP connector for those.
- Agent Plans is a Linear technology-preview API and may change.

## MCP parity

The `linear_agent_*` tools are drop-in replacements for the `mcp_linear_*` connector for the core issue / project / comment workflows, with the advantage that writes appear under the agent (app) identity, fail closed by `mutation_policy`, and echo the applied fields back:

- `update_issue` / `create_issue` resolve friendly references (`assignee` by name / email / `me`, `labels`, `project`, `team`, `cycle`, `milestone`, `delegate`) to Linear's `*Id` fields; `null` clears; raw `*Id` keys pass through. Ambiguous or unknown names abort before the mutation.
- `update_issue` manages relations (`blocks` / `blockedBy` / `relatedTo`, append-only, with `remove*` variants; `parentId`; `duplicateOf`) and URL attachments (`links`).
- `create_comment` edits an existing comment (`comment_id`, gated on `update_comments`) and posts threaded replies (`parentId`).
- `create_comment` also targets a non-issue parent — pass exactly ONE of `project_id`, `project_update_id`, `initiative_id`, `initiative_update_id`, or `document_content_id`.
- Delete tools (`delete_comment`, `delete_customer_need`, `delete_status_update`, `delete_attachment`, `delete_customer`) require explicit IDs and each gate on their own `delete_*` policy key.
- Customers (`save_customer`, `delete_customer`), release notes (`save_release_note`), and issue labels (`create_issue_label`) are covered, plus reads for teams, milestones, documents, attachments, release notes, project labels, and agent skills (`get_*` / `list_*`).

The only remaining follow-ups route through the Linear MCP connector: documentation search and the code-review diffs surface (both MCP-server internal, with no public GraphQL), and binary attachment uploads (multipart, outside the GraphQL-only scope).
